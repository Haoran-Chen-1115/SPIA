# Stochastic path-integral approach (SPIA)
Stochastic path-integral approach for determing superconducting transition temperature Tc of anharmonic systems.

# Main program
The main program is in the directory SPIA/main_nscf. 
The program basically runs from 1_GEN_CORE to 7_Collect in steps.
The directory 0_Public contains functions that are shared by multiple steps.

Parameters of the calculations can be set in 0_Public/parameter.m
